# AutoDir
`[for python3]`

A python library to automatically switch directories to the parent folder of the code.

## Example Uses:
Code:
`main.py`
```python
image = "assets/image.png"
```
If your current working directory is not the same as the parent folder of this code, your code will not work. 

This library fixes that, in a simple way.
